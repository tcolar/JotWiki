INSTALL.txt
------------------------------------

For up to date installation instructions see:
http://www.jotwiki.net/installation

------------------------------------
##Requirements##
Here is what you need:

    * A java runtime environment (from Sun)

If you don't have java installed yet, or are unsure, see here: Installing java

    * A Java Application server, ie: jetty, tomcat, jboss etc...

If you don't have one yet, see here: Installing Jetty or Installing Tomcat

    * A data folder with available disk space (/opt/jotwiki/ or c:\jotwiki).

The default installation folder is c:\jotwiki(windows) or /opt/jotwiki(other platforms).

If you don’t want or can’t use those standard installation locations, you will need to go through a few extra steps first. See: Alternate installation Location

##Installation steps##

    * Download jotwiki.zip from JOTWiki on Sourceforge

    * unzip it into a temporary folder (it will create the jotwiki_installer folder)

    * Go in “jotiwiki_installer” and Run the installer (sudo sh install.sh or install.bat)

If you want to install jotwiki to a custom folder(not /opt/jotwiki or c:\jotwiki) you will need to start the installer manually, see: Alternate installation Location

The installer will ask you a few questions and copy some files to the installation folder.
It will ask you the following:

    * If you are on a unix platform, it will ask, what is the java app server user(user it runs as), this is so that it can set the jotwiki folder with the proper user/permissions so that jotwiki can read/write to it.

Depending on which app server you are using, this user might be something like: tomcat, jetty, web-data or root(preferably not).

    * It will also ask where your app server webapp folder is, this is where web-applications(.war) go, for example for jetty browse to: [JETTY_HOME]/webapps/ .


After this is done, installation is complete, go to http://yourappserver:8080/jotwiki/home to get the configuration screens.

Configuration
------------------------------------
After completing the Installation, you will have run the initial setup.

Go to http://yourserver:8080/jotwiki/ this should present you with the setup page.

Depending of which application server you are using and configuration, the port might be other than 8080.
However 8080 is the “standard” java server port
Configuration Steps

    * You will get the setup page, fill all the fields appropriately (click the help icons if you need more infos) and click “Save”.

The most important things would be: the admin password, your mail server(optional).

    * Then you should edit the “default” namespace page, in particular the title, web URL etc... and Save

    * Click “exit setup”.


It is highly recommended to restart jotwiki (restart the app server) now so it will pick up all the new settings.

After the restart is complete, you should be able to go back to http://yourserver:8080/jotwiki/ and be presented with your brand new (blank) home page.
Jotwiki is now up and running and ready to be used !
