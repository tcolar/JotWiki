
===== Requirement =====
Jotwiki.war is a standard lightweight java web application, and the only requirement is a java application server such as jetty, tomcat or jboss.

====== Installation =====
Download the latest jotwiki.jar from http://jot.colar.net/

Once you have jotwiki.war, continue on:


==== Data Root folder ====
By default jotwiki data will go to /opt/jotwiki/default/ (c:\jotwiki\default on windows).
**If that's fine with you and you are only going to run one copy of jotwiki, you don't need to change anything and can skip "Custom root folder"**

=== Custom root folder (Optinonal)===
Otherwise here is what to do:
  * Unzip jotwiki.war (a war is just a zip file), you can use winzip or 7zip, or just run on the command line ''jar xvf jotwiki.war'' (in an empty folder).
  * Once unzip go into the jotconf folder and open jot.conf in a text editor.
  * Change the values of wiki.datafolder.windows / wiki.datafolder.others to the folder you want to use to store the wiki's data.
  * Once done, Zip the jar back together. ex: ''jar czvf jotwiki.war *''

FIXME: Explain issues with debian / java policies.

WARNING: You will have to make that change every time you upgrade jotwiki (new war)!
Otherwise jotwiki will use the default folder and won't find your existing content.

=== Creating the root folder and preparing the setup ===

  * You should create the data folder (ex: /opt/jotwiki/default/)manually and set the permissions correctly so your java server (ex: tomcat) can read/write to it.
For example:
<code>
sudo mkdir /opt/jotwiki/default/
sudo chown www:data:www:data /opt/jotwiki/default/
#sudo chown tomcat:tomcat /opt/jotwiki/default/
</code>

  * You also need to create an empty file called **runsetup.txt** (lowercase) in the data folder.
This is how you tell jotwiki to present you with the setup page (ex: ''touch /opt/jotwiki/default/runsetup.txt'')

TIP: Once you complete setup, the file runsetup.txt will be removed, and the initial setup screen should never show again unless you rec-reate manually runsetup.txt.

==== Name (Optional)=====
You might want to rename the war.
If you wan't the wiki to be located somewhere different than http://yoursite/jotwiki/, you could rename the war to a new name. (or adjust the context path in you java server).

Another reason is if you want to run multiple different wiki instances ("sites"), then you could have two copies with different names (ex: jotwiki-site1.war, jotwiki-site2.war).

==== Application server ====
jotwiki is a java webapplication and needs to be deployed to a java application server such as jetty, tomcat or jboss.

If you don't have one installed yet, see [[Installing jetty for jotwiki]]
FIXME: make the jetty installation page

==== Deploy the war file ====
You can now deploy the web application (jotwiki.war) to your application server.
On most application servers such as tomcat or jetty, it's as simple as copying jotwiki.jar into the webapps directory.
Ex: ''sudo cp jotwiki.jar /opt/jetty/webapps/''

TIP: Once the application is deployed and the server is running, you shoudl be to able check for errors in /opt/jotwiki/default/logs/
Hopefully there should not be any errors

======= Initial Setup =======

Go to http://yourserver:8080/jotwiki/ this should present you with the setup page (as lonmg as you created the runsetup.txt file as explained earlier).

TIP: depending of which application server you are using and configuration, the port might be other than 8080.
However 8080 is the "standard" java server port
Also if you customized the context or war name 'jotwiki', you will have to replace that in the URL as well.

Complete the setup page, and submit it.

Once setup is complete you should be able to go to http://yourserver:8080/jotwiki/ and be able to start using the wiki.

===== Using a proxy / Apache in front of the application server =====

FIXME: TBD
